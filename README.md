# Hi there! It's me, Bella! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ **Junior at Tufts University, studying Computer Science and Cognitive and Brain Science**
ðŸ”­ **Aspiring researcher of LLMs and Computational Linguistics**

I find language incredibly interesting and am eager to learn more about the intersection between language and technology!  
Currently, I am focusing on learning how to use machine learning models in order to further my knowledge of how these ideas
can be applied to computer science.

ðŸŽ¯ **Featured Project: Musical Analysis using MATLAB and LSTMs**
- What We Did: Preprocessed and vectorized audio data, then trained an LSTM to predict the next musical note.
- Tools: MATLAB, MATLAB's Audio Toolbox and Deep Learning

ðŸ›  **Tech Stack:**
  - Languages: C, C++, MATLAB, Python
  - Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
  - Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Git, GitHub

ðŸ“« **How to Reach Me:**
  - email: bmjuhaeri@gmail.com
  - Linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/isabella-juhaeri

âœ¨ **What I am learning/working on**
  - Currently in a Machine Structure and Assembly Language course! Next semester, I will take a machine learning course
    to further cement my understanding of ML. I will also be taking a security and computational theory course next
    semester. Excited to see what the future holds!
